    <h2>Hello, I'm Arupam</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my personal website! I am a Neuroscience Researcher at the
      <a href="https://idn.biologie.uni-mainz.de/" target="_blank" style="color: #1d4ed8; text-decoration: none;">
        Institute of Developmental Biology and Neurobiology (iDN)
      </a>, Germany.

      Neurological diseases are not only permanently debilitating but are the fastest-growing cause of death among non-communicable diseases. Strategies to promote repair of the nervous system are extremely rare, and to date, there are no therapies available.

        Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz
      </a>, in collaboration with the
      <a href="https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home" target="_blank" style="color: #1d4ed8; text-decoration: none;">
        Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research
      </a>, our interdisciplinary team combines neurobiology, neuroimmunology, chemistry, and polymer research to develop new strategies for regenerative treatments for multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries.

      Beyond the lab, I enjoy cooking and exploring new places. If you share an interest in neurobiology, regenerative medicine, or the molecular mechanisms of brain repair, I would love to connect!
